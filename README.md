# Bitcoin Mining Research: Golden Nonce Strategy

**Bitcoin Mining Research** is a Go (Golang) simulation framework designed to analyze strategies for finding the optimal nonce (“Golden Nonce”) in Bitcoin block mining.  
This project serves as a research tool for blockchain, distributed consensus, and mining performance optimization.

## What is Bitcoin Nonce?

Mining a Bitcoin block requires finding a hash of the block that meets the network difficulty target.  
The **nonce** is a special number added to the block data that determines the resulting hash.  
The **Golden Nonce** is the value that produces a hash below the target.

This research investigates whether different strategies for selecting nonces affect the efficiency of mining in an idealized scenario.

---

## Simulation

The simulation framework was implemented in Go.
- Multiple nonce sizes were tested.
- Two iteration counts were compared: 1 and 100 attempts.
- Pseudorandom sequences were generated for each nonce size using Go’s `map` structure for fast access.

> Note: Results are theoretical. In reality, each miner finds a nonce for their own block with unique transactions.  
> This simulation assumes an ideal scenario: miners start simultaneously on identical hardware and software, with identical blocks.  
> The only difference is the nonce selection strategy.

## Nonce Selection Strategies

1. **Sequential (GoOver)** — iterating from 0 to the maximum nonce.
2. **Random Picking** — selecting nonces randomly within the range.

## Results

The graphs below show the average ratio of attempts to the maximum nonce size (X-axis: maximum nonce, Y-axis: % of successful nonce findings). Lower values indicate better efficiency.

*1 iteration: Sequential (GoOver) outperforms Random Picking*

![100 Iterations Graph](https://github.com/kirill-a-belov/golden_nonce/blob/master/100itr.jpeg)  
*100 iterations: Both strategies perform similarly*

Observations:
- For realistic 32-bit Bitcoin nonces (max ~4.2 billion), the strategy choice has negligible impact over many attempts.

---

## Conclusions

1. On large numbers and high iteration counts, the choice of nonce strategy does not significantly affect outcomes.
2. Results follow a **normal distribution**, explaining why probabilities converge across strategies.
3. Alternative random generators could theoretically change outcomes, but practical probability remains extremely low (comparable to winning the lottery).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the simulation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirill-a-belov/golden_nonce.git
cd golden_nonce
go run golden_nonce.go
```

The framework is open-source, suitable for:
Research and experimentation with mining algorithms
Educational purposes in blockchain courses
Performance benchmarking of distributed systems
